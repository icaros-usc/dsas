In order to zero the MICO, use the joystick to move 
the arm into the position shown by the jpgs. It is 
easier to do this using joint-control.
The pdf includes details about which direction is 
positive or negative, but the images do NOT 
correspond to the zero position.
Once in position, launch Jacosoft and go to the 
Roboticist tab. Select "set zero position" and press
the button "Send to all". There will be no pop-up or
feedback that anything has changed. Reboot the MICO.
Once rebooted, if you are in the position shown in 
the jpgs, go to the Diognosis tab, then the JACO 
health center. Here you can see the coordinates. On
the bottom right you can select joint coordinates. 
The joints should all say about 180 degrees. Switch
to Cartesian control and see if it behaves properly.
