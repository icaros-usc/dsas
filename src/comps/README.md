# Constrained Manipulation Planning Suite

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/personalrobotics/comps.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/personalrobotics/comps)

The Constrained Manipulation Planning Suite (CoMPS) consists of three OpenRAVE
plugins and associated data files. The planning and inverse kinematics
algorithms in this suite are designed for articulated robots like robotic arms
and humanoids.

CoMPS is implemented in C++ and compiles in Linux only. There are also several
examples in Python and MATLAB that show how to interface with OpenRAVE to use
the plugins in CoMPS. It has been tested on all Ubuntu version from the last
few years and will probably work with most modern Linux distributions.

This repository is a fork of the [offical SourceForge
repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/comps/) that includes updates to
add [Catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin) integration.
